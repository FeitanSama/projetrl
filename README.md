# <center>Reinforcement Learning : real-time reconfiguration of a wireless network</center>

---

This reinforcement learning project aims to establish the implementation of reinforcement learning algorithms (ANN, Policy Iteration, Thompson, EXP3, UCB) on real-time data to simulate a direct interaction between an agent and an environment. The project focuses on the analysis of wireless networks to measure the quality of transmissions between a terminal and an antenna, with the objective of converging towards an optimal state to maximize data throughput.
